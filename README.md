# Online Personal Portfolio
## An online catalog of my projects and exerpiences
---

###### This application shows off all the Software Engineering focused work I have completed as of December 31, 2025. You can go through my page and have my top 3 projects presented to you. The other pages are my dot.cards page, about me page and a page where you can download/view my resume.

###### I built this application using React, react-bootstrap and react-router-dom. I used this React setup because I just took a class using some React so I wanted to further my understanding and ability to use React. 

###### I struggled a bit with understanding how to react-router-dom because I had no experience with it. I went to the documentation which helped, and used online tutorials as well. In the future I want to add another page that will highlight my co-op experiences.
